1		Initial value of frequency
	
		w = sigma/ tau, where sigma = sqrt(kB T)

		tau = deviation of position from it's mean position.

		1	Choice of tau be around 0.1, 0.2, 0.05

		2	sigma = sqrt(kB T)
			choice of kB is 1.0
			choice of T = 300.0 K

		For kB = 1.0, T = 300.0 K, tau = 0.1 --> w = 173.205080757
