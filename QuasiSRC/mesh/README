From the makefile:

## Makefile.am for mesh generation utilities.
##
## Just link with libquasi.a even though only need a few sources?!
##
## Old targets:
## cube         - code for generation of a cube of fcc crystal
## indentor     - code for generation of a block of fcc crystal
##                fine region is located at the top surface
## void_fcc     - generate void in a center of a block of fcc crystal
## crack        - code for generation of a crack in fcc crystal
## flat_surface - code for generation of a flat surface in fcc crystal
##
## The makefile and sources did not correspond well. I made a program
## for any source file with a main(). 
##
## It seems that not all required *.ini data files exist:
## crack_110_fcc.ini , fcc_110.ini , indent_110_fcc.ini , 
## indent_110_half_plane_fcc.ini
##
## What are the following files:  read_material.c
##
## These sources seem to be out of date: void_fcc.c , generate_fcc.c
